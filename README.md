AdvancedBoost
======

JC2-MP improved boost script with more functionalities.

Can disable boost for any vehicle class (divided in the same way as the tabs in the Advanced Buy Menu script, [found here](https://github.com/Jasonmrc/AdvancedBuyMenu)), or globally.

There is also a slider to change the amount of boost in-game. It currently goes from 0 to 100. Default is 70.
